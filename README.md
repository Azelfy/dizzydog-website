# DizzyDog Website

This is just the source code to the website that I'm making, and I'm using github to keep track of the source code changes for practise.
I just think it would be neat to have the source code listed somewhere, especially somewhere like GitHub where I can keep track of it and my pals can help out if they really want to.
